## Projects 
### European Soccer Analysis Using SQL
[Github Project Link](https://github.com/Zaki978/European-Soccer-SQL-Data-Project)

Analyzed European football data across five major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1) mainly using SQL. Through complex SQL queries, I extracted insights about team performance, player statistics, and league competitiveness from 2014 to 2020. Key analyses include analyzing home vs. away performance, tracking goal-scoring patterns, calculating team points distributions and evaluating league competitiveness through points gaps. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL including CTEs, subqueries, window functions, set operations and complex joins. I handled the full project lifecycle and infrastructure: from SQLite database setup and CSV data ingestion, to database management and export for data visualization in Tableau.

### IMBd Movie Ratings Analysis in Python (Pandas and Matplotlib)

[Github Project Repo](https://github.com/Zaki978/IMDb-Movie-Ratings-Analysis)

I conducted an in-depth analysis of IMDb movie ratings for films released over the past century (1920-2023). The primary objective was to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the data, providing a comprehensive understanding of how movie ratings have evolved for movies released over time.

The project involved extensive data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation processes which was implemented using Python and its powerful data manipulation library, pandas. I renamed columns for clarity, converted columns to appropriate data types, handled missing values, and filtered the data to include only movies with a minimum number of ratings. I also split the genres column into multiple rows to allow for genre-level analysis and created a new decade for further analysis.

One of the key areas of exploration was the analysis of trends in movie ratings. I examined how movie ratings have changed over the decades and visualized this trend using matplotlib and seaborn, Python's primary libraries for data visualization. Another significant area of focus was genre analysis. I compared average ratings of movie genres over time and identified which genres have gained or lost popularity over time.
In addition, I conducted a correlation analysis to understand how closely the ratings for each genre follow the overall trend in movie ratings. The results of this analysis provided valuable insights into the relationship between genre and movie ratings.

The final cleaned and transformed data was exported to a CSV file for further analysis and visualization in Tableau. This allowed for more complex visualizations and a more interactive exploration of the data.

### Cooking Buddy Web Application Using Python

[Github Project Link](https://github.com/Zaki978/recipefinder-final) | [Cooking Buddy Web App](https://cooking-buddy.onrender.com)

Cooking Buddy is a flask-based web application I built with two classmates as the final project for my Management Business Application Development in Python university class. As college students with limited experience cooking, we decided to create an app to help students discover recipes based on ingredients they have available.  

Users can input their available ingredients and apply filters for meal types (breakfast, lunch/dinner, snacks) and dish categories (appetizers, main courses, desserts), and receive personalized recipe suggestions complete with ingredient lists, nutritional information, and cooking instructions.

Built with Python and Flask, the application leverages the Edamam Recipe RESTful API for comprehensive recipe data, while utilizing Bootstrap 5 for a responsive, user-friendly interface. The project demonstrates skills in project management, API integration, and full-stack development.
