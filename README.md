### European Soccer Analysis Using SQL
[Github Project Link](https://github.com/Zaki978/European-Soccer-SQL-Data-Project)

Analyzed European football data across five major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1) mainly using SQL. Through complex SQL queries, I extracted insights about team performance, player statistics, and league competitiveness from 2014 to 2020. Key analyses include analyzing home vs. away performance, tracking goal-scoring patterns, calculating team points distributions and evaluating league competitiveness through points gaps. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL including CTEs, subqueries, window functions, set operations and complex joins. I engineered the complete data pipeline: from SQLite database setup and CSV data ingestion, to database management and export for data visualization in Tableau.
