## Projects 
### European Soccer Analysis Using SQL
[Github Project Link](https://github.com/Zaki978/European-Soccer-SQL-Data-Project)

Analyzed European football data across five major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1) mainly using SQL. Through complex SQL queries, I extracted insights about team performance, player statistics, and league competitiveness from 2014 to 2020. Key analyses include analyzing home vs. away performance, tracking goal-scoring patterns, calculating team points distributions and evaluating league competitiveness through points gaps. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL including CTEs, subqueries, window functions, set operations and complex joins. I handled the full project lifecycle and infrastructure: from SQLite database setup and CSV data ingestion, to database management and export for data visualization in Tableau.

###Cooking Buddy Web Application Using Python

[Github Project Link](https://github.com/Zaki978/recipefinder-final) | [Cooking Buddy Web App](https://cooking-buddy.onrender.com)

Cooking Buddy is a flask-based web application I built with two classmates for one of my university classes. As college students with limited experience cooking, we decided to create an app to help students discover recipes based on ingredients they have available.  

Users can input their available ingredients and apply filters for meal types (breakfast, lunch/dinner, snacks) and dish categories (appetizers, main courses, desserts), and receive personalized recipe suggestions complete with ingredient lists, nutritional information, and cooking instructions.

Built with Python and Flask, the application leverages the Edamam Recipe RESTful API for comprehensive recipe data, while utilizing Bootstrap 5 for a responsive, user-friendly interface. The project demonstrates skills in environment variable management, API integration, and full-stack development.
