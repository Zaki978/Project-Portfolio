## Projects 
### European Soccer Analysis Using SQL
[Github Project link] (https://github.com/Zaki978/European-Soccer-SQL-Data-Project)

This project analyzes European football data across five major leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1) using mainly SQL. Through complex SQL queries, I extracted insights about team performance, player statistics, and league competitiveness from 2014 to 2020. Key analyses include analyzing home vs. away performance, tracking goal-scoring patterns, calculating team points distributions and evaluating league competitiveness through points gaps. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL (including CTEs, window functions, and complex joins), data manipulation with pandas, and database management using SQLite. Data visualization was performed using Tableau to create interactive dashboards.
